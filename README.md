## Assignment: Image Classification with the MNIST Dataset

### Objectives
1. **Understand and preprocess the MNIST dataset**.
2. **Implement a neural network model for image classification**.
3. **Train the model on the MNIST dataset**.
4. **Evaluate the model's performance**.
5. **Interpret results and discuss potential improvements**.

### Dataset Overview
- **Training Set:** 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Image Dimensions:** 28x28 pixels.
- **Label Range:** 0 to 9 (representing digits 0 through 9).

### Assignment Tasks

#### 1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - **1.1.** Load the MNIST dataset.
   - **1.2.** Visualize a few samples from the dataset to understand the data distribution.
   - **1.3.** Normalize the pixel values of the images to a range of 0 to 1.

#### 2. **Model Implementation**
   - **2.1.** Choose a model architecture. Options include:
     - A simple feedforward neural network.
     - A convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
   - **2.2.** Implement the chosen model using a framework of your choice (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch).
   - **2.3.** Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer. Common choices include:

#### 3. **Model Training**
   - **3.1.** Train the model on the training dataset.
   - **3.2.** Monitor the training process using metrics like accuracy and loss.
   - **3.3.** Implement early stopping to avoid overfitting.

#### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **4.1.** Evaluate the model on the validation and test datasets.
   - **4.2.** Report key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **4.3.** Generate and analyze the confusion matrix.

#### 5. **Results and Discussion**
   - **5.1.** Discuss the performance of your model. Compare the results with standard benchmarks if available.
   - **5.2.** Identify potential improvements:
     - Data augmentation techniques.
     - Hyperparameter tuning.
     - Advanced model architectures.

#### 6. **Submission Requirements**
   - **6.1.** A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing all code and comments.
   - **6.2.** A brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing the approach, results, and conclusions.
   - **6.3.** Visualizations of the training process, model predictions, and confusion matrix.

## Usage

1. **Install Anaconda:**
   If you havenâ€™t installed Anaconda yet, download and install it from [the official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Create and Activate Your Environment:**

   First, ensure you have the `environment.yml` file in your working directory. This file contains the specifications for the packages and dependencies you need.

   Create the environment by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

   After creating the environment, activate it with:
   ```bash
   conda activate mnist
   ```

3. **Test Your Simple Convolutional Neural Network:**

   To test the neural network, use the following command, replacing `[model_path]` with the path to your trained model and `[input_digit_path]` with the path to the input digit image:
   ```bash
   python test.py --model_path [model_path] --digit_path [input_digit_path]
   ```

4. **Documentation:**

   The documentation for the project can be found in the `Image_classification_MNIST` folder.

5. **Training the Neural Network:**

   The code for training the neural network is located in `train.ipynb`. Open this Jupyter notebook to review and execute the training process.
